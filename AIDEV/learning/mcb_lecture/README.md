# MCB for Leaders: Architecting Context-Driven AI

## Overview
This lecture series covers the Model-Context-Behavior (MCB) framework for designing and implementing context-driven AI systems. The MCB framework provides a structured approach to building AI systems that can effectively understand and respond to different contexts.
